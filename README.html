		<H1>Slimdown</H1>
			<p>A HTML to <b>Markdown</b> conversion utility, <strike>written</strike> programmed in Python. This document can be used as the example HTML document to feed Slimdown as to show supported tags.</p>

			<p>This tool is intended for use on simple HTML documents, such as <em>basic HTML</em> wiki pages. This is what it was created for. I hope to expand its functionality in time.</p>
			<p>It does have some quirks which I hope to address in time, but for now, it was suitable for the use case I had.</p>
